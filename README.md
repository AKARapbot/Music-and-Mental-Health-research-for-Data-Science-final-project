#This is the code I uploaded for my Data Science master's degree Final Project, which includes four components:
#MXMH_research.py: This file contains the code for the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) section.
#MHmodel.py: This file contains all the modeling code used in the project.
#UI.py: This file includes the code for a Depression Test App, which predicts whether a user has a tendency toward depression based on their music listening habits and background information. The training dataset is from Kaggleâ€™s MxMH project, and the download link is: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/catherinerasgaitis/mxmh-survey-results/data.
#The plots folder contains all the images generated during the research project.
